## [Territorial acknowledgment](https://www.concordia.ca/about/indigenous/territorial-acknowledgement.html)

We acknowledge that Concordia University is located on unceded Indigenous lands. The Kanien’kehá:ka Nation is recognized as the custodians of the lands and waters on which we gather today. Tiohtiá:ke/Montreal is historically known as a gathering place for many First Nations. Today, it is home to a diverse population of Indigenous and other peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within the Montreal community.

## Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces

The Department of Design and Computation Arts is committed to fostering an equitable and positive learning experience for all students, staff and faculty, free from discrimination based for example on race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, religion, ethnicity, age, etc. We value diversity and difference, and strive together to create safer spaces in our classrooms, studios, and labs, where all students can fully engage in scholarly and artistic pursuits, knowing that harmful behaviour (e.g. harassment, microaggressions, intolerance, disrespectful language, etc.) is unacceptable. We believe that celebrating difference is fundamental to supporting an academic community where innovation, creative exploration, and intellectual freedom can flourish.

## Description

Programming isn't just about knowing the syntax of your chosen programming language, it's also about leveraging the code already written by others in your quest to create truly interesting software. In this course we shift our focus from syntax to libraries as a way to extend on our capacities and to open up new avenues for creative expression through code. Students will spend their time encountering and learning to use a variety of libraries suited to creative coding while producing their own original work in a studio environment.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

* Confidently search for, find, and use JavaScript libraries in their projects
* Leverage the power of their programming alongside libraries to create compelling interactive experiences
* Discuss and evaluate their creative coding projects

## Key activities

### Lectures

Each week will include a number of lecture videos and notes covering a specific topic in JavaScript programming and libraries for students to follow in their own time before that week's class time.

### Activities

Each topic will include a short programming activity covering the topic of the week. Students will complete the activity themselves (optionally alongside a video of the instructor doing the same work).

### Class structure

#### Discussion

Each class will being with a discussion period. The instructor will briefly recap the week's material and lead a live-coding session along with Q&A.

#### Studio time

After the start of class period, there will be studio time during which the instructor and TA will be available for specific student requests for assistance either online or in person.

Attendance of the studio period is technically optional, but students are highly encouraged to take the time to connect with the instructor and TAs, even if only to show their work in progress.

### Jams

Each major topic will have an associated "jam" project to spend time developing a creative work. Each will be used as an opportunity for students to practice and develop their programming skills with room to express their own ideas using a specific JavaScript library.

### Project

There will be a single final project in which students will develop one of their jam projects into a larger and more coherent work.

### Office hours

The instructor will be live on Discord or in person for further hours during the week explicitly to support students with questions about programming topics, activities, exercises, projects, and anything else of relevance.

## Expected skills

Students are expected to already be familiar with the core elements of JavaScript programming (including project setup, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and classes) and p5.js, although a review will be conducted in the first class. Some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS will be advantageous, but are not strictly required and can be learned during the course.

Students are further expected to be fully committed to engaging with programming as not just a technical but as a creative practice, constantly working to see ways in which the technical skills they are learning can be deployed in expressive and interesting ways and articulating those ideas both in code and speech/writing.

## Moodle

[Moodle](https://moodle.concordia.ca/) will be used to host lecture videos as well as to receive and submit assignments and grades.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://www.github.com) be used for all other course content. The course GitHub repository will contain example code, lecture notes, course information, and more. Students will be able to post questions and issues with GitHub's issue tracker as needed.

Students will create their own repository on GitHub to save, track, and present their coursework. (Actual submission will be via Moodle, for privacy.)

## Discord

[Discord](https://discord.com/) will be used as a common space for this course, for offering online teaching where needed and also online support for students' work. Everyone will use their real name (or recognizable nickname) as their nickname on the Discord. Ideally, everyone will include their pronouns at the end of their Discord nickname.

## Evaluation

Specific evaluation requirements will be provided when assigned.

* Voice Jam (12%)
* AI Jam (12%)
* Game Engine Jam (12%)
* Final Project (40%)
  * Proposal and prototype (5%)
  * Final project (35%)
* Short reflective essay (12%)
* Participation (12%)
  * Participation includes: attending class, completing coursework, being present on the Discord, asking questions, contributing to discussions, sharing ideas, and coming to office hours, emailing the instructor with updates on projects (even if you do not need help, make sure to touch base with the instructor regularly in some capacity)

## French

Students have the right to write in French at Concordia. Pippin can read French relatively well, but cannot offer substantive feedback on writing skill itself. Given that this is a programming course, you are welcome to name variables and functions in French as well as to write comments in French.

## Late work policy

* Late work of any kind will lose one letter grade per day late, beginning immediately after the deadline (e.g. if it is two days late, work that would have received a B would lose two letter grades and receive a C+)

## Academic integrity

The most common offense under the Academic Code of Conduct is plagiarism, which the Code defines as “the presentation of the work of another person as one’s own or without proper acknowledgement.” This includes material copied word for word from books, journals, Internet sites, professor’s course notes, etc. It refers to material that is paraphrased but closely resembles the original source. It also includes for example the work of a fellow student, an answer on a quiz, data for a lab report, a paper or assignment completed by another student. It might be a paper purchased from any source. Plagiarism does not refer to words alone – it can refer to copying images, graphs, tables and ideas. “Presentation” is not limited to written work. It includes oral presentations, computer assignments and artistic works. Finally, if you translate the work of another person into any other language and do not cite the source, this is also plagiarism.

**In Simple Words:** Do not copy, paraphrase or translate anything from anywhere without saying where you obtained it. (Source: [Concordia's Academic Integrity Website](https://www.concordia.ca/students/academic-integrity))

### Academic ethics when programming

When creating projects in code, make sure you attribute all elements that are not your own work, including images, sounds, and especially other people's code (provide notes and links to the original work either in a README, at the top of your script, on inline with the usage)

### Academic ethics and GitHub Copilot and other machine learning systems

Please refrain from using these tools in this course. This course completes an introductory cycle of learning programming from the ground up, one advantage of which is to better be able to use machine learning programming assistants. But you simply won't be able to learn these ideas if you create your work with an AI assistant.

## Costs

* See the [Department Syllabus](https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/finearts/design/docs/dcart-undergraduate-syllabus.pdf)
* All software students are expected to use in the class will be free.

## Technology

The practical work done in this class will take place on your own computer (with course software installed on it by you) or on the computers in the computer labs at Concordia. The instructor is significantly more experienced with macOS, but will work to support Windows and even Linux as needed. This course does not require a significantly powerful machine beyond the ability to run a web browser.
