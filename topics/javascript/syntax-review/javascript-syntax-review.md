## Summary

This module provides links to a series of short modules presenting a summary of the JavaScript syntax covered in Creative Computation I. The different modules should be reviewed as needed to re-establish familiarity with the syntax and to identify any difficult areas to get help with.

In Creative Computation II, we will be assuming that this material can be more or less taken for granted in moving forward.
