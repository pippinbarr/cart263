## Objectives
* Remembering JavaScript!
* Remembering p5.js!
* Enjoying programming!

## Setup

1. Start a new project by duplicating your sausage dog activity project folder and renaming it `wheres-sausage-dog-new-game-plus` (or something else).
2. Move this new project folder into your `exercises` folder in your course repository (create the folder if needed)
3. Commit these changes to your repository with an appropriate message like `Ex: Starting code`
4. Open the project in Atom and begin!

## Brief

Your objective is to add functionality to the existing *Where's Sausage Dog?* game to make it more fun or more interesting or more strange or something else entirely. Implement **at least three** of the following:

* Change the image set to something else you find entertaining/meaningful
* Add random rotations to animals when created so they're oriented in different ways
* Add start and end screens
* Add the ability to restart the game after you reach the end
* Add more visual effects when finding the dog (make it bounce around the screen? Change colours? Leave a trail?)
* Add sound effects to the game (have all the animals make animal sounds randomly? Make the dog bark when you get close to it?)
* Add behavior to incorrect animals when clicked (make a sound, wiggle, do something else?)
* Add a hint system to that the dog wiggles a bit if the player is taking too long to find it
* Add selectable difficulty levels (more animals? smaller? movement?)
* Add a countdown timer
* Add multiple levels
* Choose which animal is being found randomly and tell the player which one they're looking for

Some of these are very straightforward and some are not. Choose wisely such that you get some good programming practice and challenge yourself, but not so that you stress out!

If you have other ideas for additions to the game, go ahead, so long as you add at least three new things.

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **exercise** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263/tree/master/exercises/wheres-sausage-dog-new-game-plus/)
2. A link to your project on the web (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart263/exercises/wheres-sausage-dog-new-game-plus/)

## Evaluation

Grading for exercises is pass/fail. Passing requires **all** of the following to be satisfactory:

- **Runs** and **meets the brief**
- Is **well structured**, with new code added in sensible places in sensible orders
- Includes a **starting commit** and then a reasonable number of commits throughout the work that include **descriptive messages** about what was done. Messages should be **prefixed by `Ex:`** (e.g. `Ex: Made the sausage dog bite you when you annoy it.`).
- Follows all **style guidelines** (see the [Style Guide](../guides/style-guide.md))
