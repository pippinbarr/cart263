## Objectives
* Playing with voices!

---

## Setup

1. Start a new project by duplicating your Slamina activity project folder and renaming it `slamina-new-game-plus` (or something else).
2. Move this new project folder into your `exercises` folder in your course repository (create the folder if needed)
3. Commit these changes to your repository with an appropriate message like `Ex: Starting code`
4. Open the project in Atom and begin!

## Brief

Your objective is to add functionality to the existing *Slamina* game to make it more fun or more interesting or more strange or something else entirely. Implement **at least three** of the following:

* Add start and end screens
* Add more visual flair when you get an answer right or wrong
* Add sound effects when you get an answer right and wrong (could be criticism/praise via ResponsiveVoice?)
* Add a counter for how many correct guesses the user achieves
* Use a different set of answers from the corpora site to have the user guess something else
* Transform the answers in a different way than reversing them (anagrams? say them in a really hard to understand voice using ResponsiveVoice parameters?)
* Add a time limit for the user to name their guess in
* Completely change the dynamic away from a guess game to something else, what if the annyang! command was "I feel like a(n)..." or "I look like a(n)..."?
* Turn it into an attempt to guess as many real animals from the array as possible?
* Add multiple voice inputs for the user (maybe they can choose between two animals? Which is cuter?)
* Use the ResponsiveVoice callbacks to add visuals to the program while the voice is talking

Some of these are very straightforward and some are not. Choose wisely such that you get some good programming practice and challenge yourself, but not so that you stress out!

If you have other ideas for additions to the game, go ahead, so long as you add at least three new things and learn something.

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **exercise** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263/tree/master/exercises/slamina-new-game-plus/)
2. A link to your project on the web (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart263/exercises/slamina-new-game-plus/)

## Evaluation

Grading for exercises is pass/fail. Passing requires **all** of the following to be satisfactory:

- **Runs** and **meets the brief**
- Is **well structured**, with new code added in sensible places in sensible orders
- Includes a **starting commit** and then a reasonable number of commits throughout the work that include **descriptive messages** about what was done. Messages should be **prefixed by `Ex:`** (e.g. `Ex: Added scary grunting sound from ResponsiveVoice when you're wrong.`).
- Follows all **style guidelines** (see the [Style Guide](../guides/style-guide.md))
