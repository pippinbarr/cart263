# Inspiration

Here is a place for us to collecting examples of code that may be inspiring to others in the class. Let's try to largely keep it to projects where the JavaScript code is available, and ideally that's written in p5.js or some other library we're generally familiar with.

## General p5.js

- Our very own example code section: <https://pippinbarr.com/cart263/examples/>
- Pippin's collections on the p5 website: <https://editor.p5js.org/pippinbarr/collections>
- p5.js's official examples: <https://p5js.org/examples/>
- p5.js's showcase website: <https://showcase.p5js.org/#/>
- OpenProcessing's examples (look for the p5 ones in partifcular): <https://openprocessing.org/discover/#/>
- Examples via Codecademy: <https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/creative-coding-p5js-examples/>
- Steve's Coding Fun YouTube playlist: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnJOmsprq3bErSNvxK0OV-Adh1uxRhVdo>
