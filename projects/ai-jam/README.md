# AI Jam

## Grade

Worth 12% of final grade.

## Deadlines

* Section A (Tuesdays): 25 February 2024
* Section B (Thursdays): 27 February 2024

If there is a serious need for an extension, contact your instructor at least 3 days *before* the deadline.

## Brief

Using ml5.js (and any other libraries you wish), create a prototype that engages with one or more of the AI functions available (e.g. object detection, hand detection, face mesh, body segementation, and more).

Your prototype should explore a specific experience you're interested in evoking or questioning, with the majority of your efforts going into this exploration rather than polishing the prototype or adding content. Three examples:

* *Alien Eyes*. AI vision is very strange because it sees in a fundamentally different way to us. What if you made an experience that was about trying to understand how the computer sees objects using ObjectDetector? They could try to get the most comical misclassification and save that out as an image to share with others.
* *Social Distances*. PoseNet would let us differentiate between whether the user is away from the computer (their pose is visible) or not. We could make the user repeatedly perform up-close tasks (say with the keyboard) and far away fasts (say with their body). FaceMesh could be used in this way too? This could be a way to explore a more physical relationship to the computer.
* *All The Feels*. Sentiment analysis is really weird, it attaches a single number to describe how positive or negative a text is. Seems like it could be the basis of an unusual personality test (Voight-Kampff anyone?) or other highly judgemental interactive experience?

Make sure to explore a well-defined *idea* in your prototype. It could be funny, scary, emo, weird, or something else. Just make sure it's at least a little *surprising*, we're aiming for novelty here.

When coming up with your idea(s), *start with the possibilities present in ml5.js and go from there*. Try not to imagine a fantasy project and then to figure out how to make it. Start with the technical reality and turn it into something interesting.

Please follow the [Style Guide](../../guides/style-guide.md).

## Technical details

Feel free to create a repository only for this project, or to work in a subfolder of your `cart263` repository. A dedicated repository is more in line with real life developers, but either is fine.

## Inspiration

* [Blade Runner's Voight-Kampff Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umc9ezAyJv0) (film scene; the idea of testing an AI on its inner life)
* [They're Made Out of Meat](https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html) (short story; an alien perspective on our world)
* [Napolean Dynamite's Happy Hands Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5G3XKsq7Ic) (film scene; hand movement as dance)
* [Nintendo's Muscle March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp9sacvNIAU) (videogame; body poses as interaction)
* ... feel free to suggest more to the instructor to add them here.

## Submission

Submit a link to your running prototype and a link to the project folder in your repository on GitHub on Moodle. *Please check your runing prototype actually runs online and not just locally*.

## Evaluation criteria
