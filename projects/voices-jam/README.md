# Voices Jam

## Grade

Worth 12% of final grade.

## Deadlines

* Section A (Tuesdays): 6 February 2024
* Section B (Thursdays): 8 February 2024

If there is a serious need for an extension, contact your instructor at least 3 days *before* the deadline.

## Brief

Using p5.speech and any other libraries you wish (just p5 + p5.speech is fine though), create a prototype that engages with speech either in terms of synthesis, recognition, or both.

Your prototype should explore a specific experience you're interested in evoking or questioning, with the majority of your efforts going into this exploration rather than polishing the prototype or adding content. Three examples:

* *Power dynamics between people and computers*. You could invert this and have the computer tell the user what to do and what to say. You could make the user the boss but have them develop a weird empathy for the computer's situation.
* *Lost in translation*. You could explore the difficulties around understanding other people (or computers) by playing with voice synthesis and recognition settings in different ways, perhaps language settings especially in this case.
* *Technical difficulties*. You could explore the ways in which voice recognition and synthesis are *not* ideal solutions to some kinds of interactions. Would you want to drive your car with voice input? Probably not. Would you want to perform surgery by telling a robotic arm how to move with a scalpel? Unlikely.

Make sure to explore a well-defined *idea* in your prototype. It could be funny, scary, emo, weird, or something else. Just make sure it's at least a little *surprising*, we're aiming for novelty here.

When coming up with your idea(s), *start with the possibilities present in p5.speech and go from there*. Try not to imagine a fantasy project and then to figure out how to make it. Start with the technical reality and turn it into something interesting.

## Repository

Feel free to create a repository only for this project, or to work in a subfolder of your `cart263` repository. A dedicated repository is more in line with real life developers, but either is fine.

## Inspiration

* [*Blade Runner*: "Enhance"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHwjceFcF2Q)
* [*2001: A Space Odyssey*: "I'm sorry, Dave"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mme2Aya_6Bc)
* [*ENHANCE.COMPUTER* by Nicole He](https://www.enhance.computer/)
* [Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney's "Objection!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn1qtUM6iCU) (You used to be able to shout "Objection!" on the Nintendo DS to raise an objection in court)
* ... feel free to suggest more to the instructor to add them here.

## Submission

Submit a link to your running prototype and a link to the project folder in your repository on GitHub on Moodle. *Please check your runing prototype actually runs online and not just locally*.
