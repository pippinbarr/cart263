# Final Project

## Grade

Worth 35% of final grade.

* Proposal and prototype 5%
* Final project 30%

## Deadlines

### Proposal and prototype

* Section A (Tuesdays): 24 - 31 March 2024 (e.g. within that week)
* Section B (Thursdays): 26 March - 2 April 2024 (e.g. within that week)

Given there is a week's buffer here, no extensions will be considered unless there is an emergency.

### Final

* Section A (Tuesdays): Sunday, 21 April 2024
* Section B (Thursdays): Sunday, 21 April 2024

Because this final date is already pushed back quite far, there won't be any extensions offered. If you can't make this date because of an emergency, contact your instructor about potentially requiring an incomplete (INC) grade.

## Overall Brief

The final project is a chance to develop one of your jam projects (speech, AI, game engine) into a more significant and presentable work. This most of all means developing it further *technically* but can also include some amount of more aesthetic/content polish. Be sure to clearly indicate the *added* features, code, content of the project to differentiate it clearly from the jam prototype.

If you want to create an entirely *new* project, that is also fine.

Make sure to explore a well-defined *idea* in your prototype. It could be funny, scary, emo, weird, or something else. Just make sure it's at least a little *surprising*, we're aiming for novelty here.

Please follow the [Style Guide](../../guides/style-guide.md).

## Prototype and proposal

The prototype and proposal stage is a chance to get some initial feedback and assistance with your overall idea. The earlier you submit it the better in terms of being able to take in that feedback.

Your prototype should express some progress in the direction you're going for the overall project - if based on a previous jam it should be clearly distinct and involve modifications.

Your proposal PDF should be **roughly two pages long** including any sketches/mockups and should explain your plans for the final project in terms of the **overall Big Idea** you're wanting to express as well as the **technical plans** to pull it off. As needed, you should also **identify any major challenges** you perceive you may need support with.

The proposal needs to reflect clear thinking about the project and your goals.

## Final project

The final project will be, as you might imagine, the most developed version of your idea you're able to produce in the timeframe given.

## Other technical details

Feel free to create a repository only for this project, or to work in a subfolder of your `cart263` repository. A dedicated repository is more in line with real life developers, but either is fine.

## Submission

In both cases, submit a link to your running project and a link to the project folder in your repository on GitHub on Moodle.

For the prototype and proposal, **make sure your proposal PDF is in the root directory of your project folder**.

Please **check your running prototype actually runs online** and not just locally.
