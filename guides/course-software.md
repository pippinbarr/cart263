# Course Software

Here are instructions for getting your system ready to follow along with the core tools we use in the course.

## A browser

We use a __web browser__ to run our programs in this course. Any web browser is fine so long as you are able to enable the "developer tools". If you're unsure, just used __Chrome__ or __Firefox__. You probably already have one or both of these installed, but if not, here are the links to install them:

- Chrome can be downloaded at <https://www.google.com/chrome/>
- Firefox can be downloaded at <https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/>

## VS Code

We use __VS Code__ as our text editor. It's a nice, free, text editor. Even if you prefer some other text editor, you should use VS Code.

1. Go to <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
1. Download VS Code to your computer
1. Install it by following its instructions

## Extensions/packages

One great thing about modern text editors is that they are highly extensible via  __extensions/packages__. Feel free to install any of these you're interested in, but at the very least install *Live Server* by searching for it in the search bar of the "Extensions" section (the four little boxes with one flying away on the left-hand side of the VS Code window)

## GitHub Desktop

We will be using __version control__ as a central part of this course. To make our lives easier we're going to use __GitHub Desktop__ so we have a nice user-interface to version control.

1. Go to <https://desktop.github.com/>
1. Use the link to download GitHub Desktop to your computer
1. Install it

For now, __don't run GitHub Desktop__ as you won't have created your course repository, which is what we will use it for.

## Zoom

We will sometimes use __Zoom__. It is the dominant videoconferencing software at the moment and the one endorsed by the university.

1. Go to <https://zoom.us/download> and follow the download instructions

To use Zoom you will usually simply be emailed a link that looks something like

<https://concordia-ca.zoom.us/my/pippin.barr>

When you click the link your browser will try to open Zoom and connect to the videoconference. If something goes funny, you can also join a meeting by running Zoom yourself and entering the "Meeting ID", which is the 10-digital number at the end of the link above.

## Discord

We will generally use __Discord__ to communicate as a class. Discord is a fairly standard instant messaging, voice- and video-chat, and screen sharing application. To use Zoom it is best to have the application on your computer. You'll also need an account.

1. Go to <https://discord.com/register> and follow the instructions to register for a Discord account
1. Go to <https://discord.com/new> to download the Discord application for your computer
1. Run Discord and log in

You will be emailed a link to join the course Discord. Please don't share it with anyone outside the course.

## Summary

We now have the key software for this course.

1. We use a __browser__ (like Chrome or Firefox) to run our programs
1. We use __VS Code__ as a text editor to write our programs
1. We use __GitHub Desktop__ and __GitHub__ to store our work in a repository
1. We use __Zoom__ for live videoconferencing when needed
1. We use __Discord__ as our home base for communicating about the course
